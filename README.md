# REACT SNAKE GAME

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Snake is the common name for a video game concept where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### How to Play?

 Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to play the game. Keep the snake within the boundary and continue to eat food to increase length. Play Game. 

### How it Works?

The player controls a dot, square, or object on a bordered plane. As it moves forward, it leaves a trail behind, resembling a moving snake.
